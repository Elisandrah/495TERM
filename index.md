# Goals
1. Create an app to help mothers and nurses stay informed of their maternal health.
2. Increase communication between mothers and nurses.
3. Educate mothers on information relating to their pregnancy.

# Approach

## Frameworks APIs and Tools

  React Native - Provides iOS and Android support for the app<br />
  Trello - Online bulletin board for task management<br />
  Doxygen - Useful code documentation tool good for code maintenance down the line<br />

## Description of Experience

  A user, whether a healthcare provider or an expecting mother, will log into one simple user interface 
  in-app and will then be taken to two separate portals, one for data entry and parent 
  focused content (for the mothers), and another focused around data reviewal as well as 
  tele-medicine options. From these two portals, nurses, doctors, and mothers will be able to have 
  a full, singular tele-medicine experience all in one place. A variety of features are to be introduced 
  as we face to face with more of the TERM staff, and get a more concrete idea of the totality of
  needed features.
