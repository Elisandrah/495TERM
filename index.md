## Description of Experience

  A user, whether a healtcare provider or an expecting mother, will log into one simple user interface 
  in-app and will then be taken to two separate portals, one for data entry and parent 
  focused content (for the mothers), and another focused around data reviewal as well as 
  tele-medicine options. From these two portals, nurses, doctors, and mothers will be able to have 
  a full, singular tele-medicine experience all in one place. A variety of features are to be introduced 
  as we face to face with more of the TERM staff, and get a more concrete idea of the totality of
  needed features.
