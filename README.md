## CS495 Capstone Project - TERM

Ensure you are on Installation Tab
https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/
Install Requirements Node.JS Release 14.15.5 LTS
Ensure you have an installation of GIT as well

I am using Powershell and running it as Administrator to do these things.

Within powershell run "npm install --global expo-cli"
Verify the installation with "expo whoami"
Create your expo account and login within this powershell

Download Android studio's tools
https://docs.expo.io/workflow/android-studio-emulator/

Follow instructions within to setup the program and create your virtual device
I chose Pixel 4 API 30

Within Android Studio boot up the virtual device that you have setup

Under the experimental branch currently is the barebones template app that exists.
Within the powershell navigate to the directory where the folder for the experimental branch is located.
When inside that folder use the command "expo start"

This will launch a web browser that looks like this https://gyazo.com/f75be5b5826ca4a19799e45dd841bc4d
Within here you can then run the app on either an android device, a web instance or if you have installed "Expo Go" on your iphone you can open the app there and after
logging in start the app there. Make sure that your connection is set to "Tunnel" otherwise you may not be able to connect to it on your phone.
