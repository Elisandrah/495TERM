/* This class handles ALL STACK NAVIGATION inside the Information Tab.
  ANY TIME YOU ADD A NEW INFO PAGE, MAKE SURE IT IS IN THIS NAVIGATOR!
  
  This class can be used in another tab/drawer/etc. navigator via
    import InfoNavigationHelper from './NavigationHelper'
    and
    <MyTab.Screen name="MyScreen" component={InfoNavigationHelper} />
  
  Stack navigation for other tabs (Home, Contact, etc.) can be added to this same file,
  just follow the same template.*/
