    id: 'Nausea',
    details: `Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a common condition. It can occur any time during the day, even though it’s often called “morning sickness.” Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy usually doesn’t harm the fetus, but it can affect your life, including your ability to work or go about your normal everyday activities. There are safe treatment options that can make you feel better and keep your symptoms from getting worse.
    \nYou should talk with your obstetrician-gynecologist (ob-gyn) or other obstetric care provider if nausea and vomiting of pregnancy affects your life and causes you concern.
    \nSome medical conditions can cause nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. These conditions include:
    \u2b24Ulcer
    \u2b24Food-related illness
    \u2b24Thyroid or gallbladder disease
    \nYour ob-gyn or other obstetric care provider might suspect that you have one of these conditions if you have signs or symptoms that usually do not occur with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Some of these signs and symptoms include:
    \u2b24Nausea and vomiting that occurs for the first time after 9 weeks of pregnancy
    \u2b24Abdominal pain or tenderness
    \u2b24Fever
    \u2b24Headache
    \u2b24Enlarged thyroid gland (swelling in the front of the neck)
    \nChanges to your diet and lifestyle might help you feel better. These changes can include:
    \u2b24Taking vitamins
    \u2b24Adjusting meal times
    \u2b24Changing the types of foods you eat
    \nThe following may help soothe nausea:
    \u2b24Eat dry toast or crackers in the morning before you get out of bed to avoid moving around on an empty stomach.
    \u2b24Eat five or six “mini meals” a day to ensure that your stomach is never empty.
    \u2b24Eat frequent bites of foods like nuts, fruits, or crackers.`

    id: 'Dehydration',
    details: `You should call your ob-gyn or other obstetric care provider if you have the following signs and symptoms of dehydration:
    \u2b24You have a small amount of urine that is dark in color.
    \u2b24You are unable to urinate.
    \u2b24You cannot keep down liquids.
    \u2b24You are dizzy or faint when standing up.
    \u2b24You have a racing or pounding heartbeat.
    \nDuring pregnancy you should drink 8 to 12 cups (64 to 96 ounces) of water every day. Water has many benefits. It aids digestion and helps form the amniotic fluid around the fetus. Water also helps nutrients circulate in the body and helps waste leave the body.`

  {
    id: 'Constipation',
    details: `Common causes of constipation include not eating enough fiber, not drinking enough water, certain medications, and changes in routine (such as travel). Constipation can occur during pregnancy. The increased levels of hormones during pregnancy can slow down the digestive system. 
    \nIf constipation continues, your health care provider may suggest a laxative. Most of these products are available without a prescription.
    \nYou can help prevent constipation by:
    \u2b24Drinking plenty of fluids
    \u2b24Eating at least 25 grams of fiber a day
    \u2b24Exercising
    \u2b24Not holding your stool—using the bathroom when you feel the urge to have a bowel movement`

  {
    id: 'Back pain',
    details: `Backache is one of the most common pregnancy problems, especially in the later months. The pain usually goes away after the baby is born. But for many women, back pain lingers for months after giving birth.
    \nThere are several things you can do to prevent or ease back pain. For example, wear supportive clothing and shoes. Pay attention to your position when sitting, sleeping, and lifting things. If you need to stand for a long time, rest one foot on a stool or a box to take the strain off your back. You also can use heat or cold to soothe sore muscles.
    \nLook for an abdominal support garment (for sale in maternity stores and catalogs). It looks like a girdle and helps take the weight of your belly off your back muscles. Also, some maternity pants come with a wide elastic band that fits under the curve of your belly to help support its weight.
    \nWear low-heeled (but not flat) shoes with good arch support, such as walking shoes or athletic shoes. Avoid high heels—they tilt your body forward and strain your lower back muscles.
    \nSit in chairs with good back support or tuck a small pillow behind your lower back. Lumbar supports, special devices that support the lower back, are sold at office supply and medical supply stores.
    \nIf you must lift something, squat down, bend your knees, and keep your back straight. Do not bend at the waist to pick up things.
    \nSleeping on your side is best later in pregnancy. Keep one or both knees bent. It also may help to place a pillow between your knees and another under your belly. You also can try a full-length body pillow.
    \nIf you have severe back pain, or if the pain goes on for more than two weeks, call your obstetrician–gynecologist (ob-gyn) or other obstetric care provider. He or she will want to rule out other causes of the pain.
    \nBack pain can be a sign of some pregnancy complications. For example, back pain can be a symptom of preterm labor. Pain also can be a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI). Contact your ob-gyn or other obstetric care provider if, in addition to back pain, you:
    \u2b24Have a fever
    \u2b24Feel burning during urination
    \u2b24Have vaginal bleeding`

    id: 'High blood pressure',
    details: `A blood pressure reading is classified into one of five categories: normal, elevated, stage 1 hypertension, stage 2 hypertension, and hypertensive crisis. Recognizing high blood pressure is important. If you have high blood pressure, you often can make lifestyle changes to prevent the development of hypertension.
    \nThe following factors that increase the risk of high blood pressure cannot be changed:
    \u2b24Age—Blood pressure increases with age.
    \u2b24Family history—High blood pressure tends to run in families.
    \u2b24Medical conditions—Certain diseases, such as diabetes mellitus and kidney disease, increase the risk of high blood pressure.
    \u2b24History of preeclampsia
    \nLifestyle habits also can affect blood pressure. These are things you can change. You are at greater risk of high blood pressure if you
    \u2b24are overweight
    \u2b24are not physically active
    \u2b24smoke cigarettes
    \u2b24drink more than two alcoholic drinks per day
    \u2b24eat a poor diet (too much fat, not enough fruits and vegetables)
    \u2b24eat too much salt
    \nMaking lifestyle changes can decrease your risk of developing high blood pressure in the future:
    \u2b24Quit smoking.
    \u2b24Lose weight if you are overweight.
    \u2b24Limit your intake of alcohol.
    \u2b24Exercise regularly.
    \u2b24Cut back on salt.
    \u2b24Change your diet—The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) eating plan focuses on heart-healthy foods. To find out more about DASH, go to www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/resources/heart/hbp-dash-index.
    \u2b24Relieve stress.
    \nIf lifestyle changes alone do not lower your blood pressure, medications usually are recommended. Many types of medications are available that work in different ways. It is important to continue taking your medication even when you are feeling healthy. It also is important to continue your healthy lifestyle habits even if taking medication lowers your blood pressure readings into the healthy range.`

    id: 'Preeclampsia',
    details: `Preeclampsia, or severe high blood pressure, can develop quietly without you being aware of it. Symptoms can include
    \u2b24swelling of face or hands
    \u2b24headache that will not go away
    \u2b24seeing spots or changes in eyesight
    \u2b24pain in the upper abdomen or shoulder
    \u2b24nausea and vomiting (in the second half of pregnancy)

    id: 'Depression',
    details: `Depression is a common but serious illness. It is more than just feeling sad or upset for a short time or feeling grief after a loss. Depression changes your thoughts, feelings, behavior, and physical health. It can affect how you relate to your family, friends, and coworkers. It can occur at different times of life or in different situations. It also can occur as part of other disorders.
    \nDepression causes a mix of emotional and physical symptoms. You have depression if you have five of the following symptoms most of the day, every day, during the same 2-week period. One of the symptoms must be either sad or depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in previously enjoyed activities:
    \u2b24Sad or depressed mood
    \u2b24Loss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy
    \u2b24Weight loss when not dieting or weight gain; decrease or increase in appetite
    \u2b24Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much
    \u2b24Moving more slowly or moving more quickly than usual
    \u2b24Fatigue or loss of energy
    \u2b24Feelings of worthlessness or guilt
    \u2b24Having trouble thinking, concentrating, or making decisions
    \u2b24Thoughts of death or suicide
    \nResearchers do not know for certain what causes depression. They do know that depression is a brain disorder in which the parts of the brain that control mood, sleep, and thinking are not functioning properly. Depression may be caused by an imbalance in certain chemicals in the brain.
    \nDepression is treated with psychotherapy, medications called antidepressants, or both.
    \nIn psychotherapy or "talk therapy," a therapist will work with you to identify problems and suggest ways you might change your behavior to help relieve your symptoms. You may have one-on-one therapy (with just you and the therapist) or group therapy where you meet with a therapist and other people with problems similar to yours. Another option is family or couples therapy, in which you and family members or your partner may work with a therapist.
    \nAntidepressants are medications that work to balance the chemicals in the brain that control your moods. There are many types of antidepressants. If one type does not work for you, your health care professional can prescribe another. Drugs often can be combined. It may take some time to find the drug or combination of drugs that works best for you. It often takes at least 3–4 weeks of taking the medication before you start to feel better.`

    id: 'Pelvic pain',
    details: `Chronic pelvic pain can be caused by a variety of conditions. Some of these conditions may not be related to the reproductive organs but to the urinary tract or bowel. Some women have more than one condition that might be the cause of their pain. For some women with chronic pelvic pain, no cause is found.
    \nSeveral pain-relief measures can be used to treat chronic pelvic pain. They include medications, physical therapy, nutritional therapy, and surgery:
    \u2b24Lifestyle changes—Good posture and regular exercise may help reduce pelvic pain.
    \u2b24Pain-relieving drugs—Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are helpful in relieving pelvic pain, especially dysmenorrhea.
    \u2b24Physical therapy—Acupuncture, acupressure, and nerve stimulation therapies may be useful in treating pain caused by dysmenorrhea. Physical therapy that eases trigger points may give relief of muscular pain. Some types of physical therapy teach mental techniques for coping with pain. Such types include relaxation exercises and biofeedback.
    \u2b24Nutrition therapy—Vitamin B1 and magnesium may be used to relieve dysmenorrhea.
    \u2b24Surgery—Pelvic pain that does not respond to other treatments can be relieved by surgery. Cutting or destroying nerves blocks pain signals from reaching tissues and organs.`

    id: 'Vaginal bleeding',
    details: `Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy has many causes. Some are serious, whereas others are not. Bleeding can occur early or later in pregnancy. Bleeding in early pregnancy is common. In many cases, it does not signal a major problem. Bleeding later in pregnancy can be more serious. It is best to contact your obstetrician–gynecologist (ob-gyn) or other health care professional if you have any bleeding at any time during pregnancy.
    \nBleeding in the first trimester happens to about 15–25% of pregnant women. Light bleeding or spotting can occur 1–2 weeks after fertilization when the fertilized egg implants in the lining of the uterus. The cervix may bleed more easily during pregnancy because more blood vessels are developing in this area. It is not uncommon to have spotting or light bleeding after sexual intercourse or after a Pap test or pelvic exam.
    \nCommon problems that may cause light bleeding later in pregnancy include inflammation of or growths on the cervix. Heavy bleeding is a more serious sign. Heavy bleeding may be caused by a problem with the placenta. Any amount of bleeding also may signal preterm labor. If you have any bleeding late in pregnancy, contact your ob-gyn right away or go immediately to the hospital.
    \nSeveral problems with the placenta later in pregnancy can cause bleeding:
    \u2b24Placental abruption—In placental abruption, the placenta detaches from the wall of the uterus before or during birth. The most common signs and symptoms are vaginal bleeding and abdominal or back pain. Placental abruption can cause serious complications if it is not found early. The fetus may not get enough oxygen, and the pregnant woman can lose a large amount of blood.
    \u2b24Placenta previa—When the placenta lies low in the uterus, it may partly or completely cover the cervix. This is called placenta previa. It may cause vaginal bleeding. This type of bleeding often occurs without pain. Some types of placenta previa resolve on their own by 32–35 weeks of pregnancy as the lower part of the uterus stretches and thins out. Labor and delivery then can happen normally. If placenta previa does not resolve, you may need to have the baby early by cesarean delivery.
    \u2b24Placenta accreta—When the placenta (or part of the placenta) invades and is inseparable from the uterine wall, it is called placenta accreta. Placenta accreta can cause bleeding during the third trimester and severe blood loss during delivery. Most cases can be found during pregnancy with a routine ultrasound exam. Sometimes, though, it is not discovered until after the baby is born. If you have placenta accreta, you are at risk of life-threatening blood loss during delivery. Your ob-gyn will plan your delivery carefully and make sure that all needed resources are available. You may need to have your baby at a hospital that specializes in this complication. Hysterectomy often needs to be done right after delivery to prevent life-threatening blood loss.
    \nLate in pregnancy, vaginal bleeding may be a sign of labor. If labor starts before 37 weeks of pregnancy, it is called preterm labor. Other signs of preterm labor include the following:
    \u2b24Change in vaginal discharge (it becomes watery, mucus-like, or bloody) or increase in amount of vaginal discharge
    \u2b24Pelvis or lower abdominal pressure
    \u2b24Constant, low dull backache
    \u2b24Mild abdominal cramps, with or without diarrhea
    \u2b24Regular or frequent contractions or uterine tightening, often painless (four times every 20 minutes or eight times an hour for more than 1 hour)
    \u2b24Ruptured membranes (your water breaks—either a gush or a trickle)
    \nHow preterm labor is managed is based on what is thought to be best for your health and your fetus’s health. In some cases, medications may be given. When preterm labor is too far along to be stopped or there are reasons that the baby should be born early, it may be necessary to deliver the baby.`

    id: 'Vaginal discharge',
    details: `Normal vaginal discharge is clear to white and does not have a noticeable odor. Signs of abnormal discharge include a change in the color, odor, amount, or consistency from what is usual for you. A certain amount of vaginal odor is normal. If the odor is strong and noticeable, an infection or other problem may be the cause. If you feel that you need to cover up the odor, you may have a medical condition that needs treatment. Sprays, deodorants, and douches are not recommended and may make things worse.
    \nA thick mucus plug forms at the cervix during pregnancy. When the cervix begins to dilate several days before labor begins or at the start of labor, the plug is pushed into the vagina. You may notice an increase in vaginal discharge that is clear, pink, or slightly bloody. Some women expel the entire mucus plug.
    \nDischarge may also be a result of the rupturing of membranes. When the fluid-filled amniotic sac that surrounds the fetus during pregnancy breaks, it is called the rupture of membranes. This is also referred to as your “water breaking.” You may feel this as fluid that trickles or gushes from your vagina. If your water breaks, call the office of your obstetrician–gynecologist (ob-gyn) or other obstetric care provider and follow their instructions.`

  {
    id: 'Contractions',
    details: `As your uterus contracts, you may feel pain in your back or pelvis. This pain may be similar to menstrual cramps. Labor contractions happen in a regular pattern and get closer together over time.
    \nBraxton Hicks contractions can happen for many weeks before real labor begins. These “practice” contractions can be very painful and can make you think you are in labor when you are not. You might notice them more at the end of the day.
    \nUsually, “false” contractions are less regular and not as strong as “true” labor. Time your contractions and note whether they continue when you are resting and drinking water. If rest and hydration make the contractions go away, they are not true labor contractions.
    \nBelow is a summary of some differences between true labor and false labor. But sometimes the only way to tell the difference is by having a vaginal exam to find changes in your cervix that signal the start of labor.
    \nTiming and frequency of contractions:
    \u2b24True labor contractions come at regular intervals. They have a pattern. As time goes on, they get closer together. Each lasts about 60 or 90 seconds.
    \u2b24False contractions do not have a pattern and they do not get closer together. These are called Braxton Hicks contractions.
    \nChange with movement:
    \u2b24True labor contractions continue even when you rest or move around.
    \u2b24False contractions may stop when you walk or rest. They also may stop with a change of position.
    \nStrength of contractions:
    \u2b24True labor contractions steadily get stronger.
    \u2b24False contractions are weak and do not get much stronger. They may start strong and then weaken.
    \nLocation of pain:
    \u2b24Pain from true labor contractions usually starts in the back and moves to the front.
    \u2b24Pain from false contractions usually is felt only in the front.
    \nIf you think you are in labor (or are not sure), call your ob-gyn or other obstetric care provider. You should go to the hospital if you have any of these signs:
    \u2b24Your water has broken and you are not having contractions.
    \u2b24You are bleeding heavily from the vagina.
    \u2b24You have constant, severe pain with no relief between contractions.
    \u2b24You notice the fetus is moving less often.`

  {
    id: 'Breast pain',
    details: `There are two types of breast pain: cyclic and noncyclic.
    \nCyclic breast pain occurs in response to changes in hormone levels. Your breasts may feel swollen, more sensitive, or painful before your menstrual period. You may have similar symptoms if you use combined hormonal contraception such as birth control pills or hormone therapy for symptoms of menopause.
    \nNoncyclic breast pain is not related to the menstrual cycle. It usually occurs in one breast in one specific area. Many things can cause this type of pain, including injury, infection, medications, and large breast size. In rare cases, noncyclic breast pain can be caused by breast cancer.
    \nFor cyclic breast pain, wearing a well-fitted bra and taking pain-relieving medications can help. If you are on combined hormonal birth control, using your method continuously may improve symptoms. Talk with your ob-gyn if you want to learn more about this option.
    \nIf you have noncyclic breast pain, see your ob-gyn.`

    id: 'Nipple discharge',
    details: `Benign discharge tends to occur in both breasts and only when the breast or nipple is squeezed. It is usually milky white or greenish in color. Discharge that is bloody or clear is more concerning.
    \nDischarge from the nipple is a common benign breast symptom. During pregnancy, nipple discharge is normal as the breasts get ready to produce milk. In women who are not pregnant, it can be caused by hormonal changes. Some medications can cause nipple discharge. Nipple discharge should be checked by an ob-gyn.`

  {
    id: 'Weight gain',
    details: `Weight gain depends on your health and your body mass index (BMI) before you were pregnant. If you were underweight before pregnancy, you should gain more weight than a woman who had a normal weight before pregnancy. If you were overweight or obese before pregnancy, you should gain less weight. The amount of weight gain differs by trimester:
    \u2b24During your first 12 weeks of pregnancy—the first trimester—you might gain only 1 to 5 pounds or none at all.
    \u2b24If you were a healthy weight before pregnancy, you should gain a half-pound to 1 pound per week in your second and third trimesters.
    You and your ob-gyn or other obstetric care provider will work together to develop a nutrition and exercise plan. If you are gaining less than what the guidelines suggest, and if your fetus is growing well, gaining less than the recommended guidelines can have benefits. If your fetus is not growing well, changes may need to be made to your diet and exercise plan.`

    \u2b24feel like you need to sleep at times that are out of sync with your work or social schedules
    \nMany women have trouble sleeping during pregnancy. This may be because of the many changes their bodies are going through. Levels of estrogen and progesterone increase during pregnancy, which can change sleep patterns. Weight gain also can make the airway swell, leading to snoring and obstructive sleep apnea.
    \nTrouble sleeping also is common after giving birth, as your baby adjusts to a regular sleep schedule. Insomnia or sleep problems after birth also may be caused by
    \u2b24pain
    \u2b24breastfeeding
