        question: "Why is nutrition during pregnancy important?",
        answer: "Eating well is one of the best things you can do during pregnancy. Good nutrition helps you handle the extra demands on your body as your pregnancy progresses. The goal is to balance getting enough nutrients to support the growth of your fetus and maintaining a healthy weight."

        question: "How much should I eat during pregnancy?",
        answer: "The popular saying is that pregnant women “eat for two,” but now we know that it’s dangerous to eat twice your usual amount of food during pregnancy. Instead of “eating for two,” think of it as eating twice as healthy.\n\nIf you are pregnant with one fetus, you need an extra 340 calories per day starting in the second trimester (and a bit more in the third trimester). That's roughly the calorie count of a glass of skim milk and half a sandwich. Women carrying twins should consume about 600 extra calories a day, and women carrying triplets should take in 900 extra calories a day."

        question: "What is labor induction?",
        answer: "Inducing labor, or induction, is the act of using drugs or a procedure to start the birth sooner, instead of waiting for labor to start naturally. Sometimes induction is the right source, but it has its risks and doesn't always work. If it doesn't, you may need another induction or a c-section. Most experts say it's bets to let labor begin on its own and progress naturally unless there is a clear medical reason."

        question: 'Why is labor induced?',
        answer: "1 out of 4 women in the U.S. start labor with induction. Some reasons: You're 1-2 weeks past your due date. Your water breaks but labor doesn't start, raising the risk of infection. A problem puts you or your baby's health at risk; such problems include conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, preeclampsia, or eclampsia. Some doctors recommend \"elective\" inductions for non-medical reasons. Maybe you live far from the hospital or maybe your doctor asks you to accommodate their schedule. Experts say you should reconsider though, because induction poses some risks."
