        question: "Why is nutrition during pregnancy important?",
        answer: `Eating well is one of the best things you can do during pregnancy. Good nutrition helps you handle the extra demands on your body as your pregnancy progresses. The goal is to balance getting enough nutrients to support the growth of your fetus and maintaining a healthy weight.`

        id: 'Nutrition2',
        question: "How much should I eat during pregnancy?",
        answer: `The popular saying is that pregnant women “eat for two,” but now we know that it’s dangerous to eat twice your usual amount of food during pregnancy. Instead of “eating for two,” think of it as eating twice as healthy.\n\u2b24If you are pregnant with one fetus, you need an extra 340 calories per day starting in the second trimester (and a bit more in the third trimester). That's roughly the calorie count of a glass of skim milk and half a sandwich. Women carrying twins should consume about 600 extra calories a day, and women carrying triplets should take in 900 extra calories a day.`

      },
      {
        id: 'Nutrition9',
        question: "How much folic acid should I take?",
        answer: `When you are pregnant you need 600 micrograms of folic acid each day. Because it’s hard to get this much folic acid from food alone, you should take a daily prenatal vitamin with at least 400 micrograms starting at least 1 month before pregnancy and during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\u2b24Women who have had a child with an NTD should take 4 milligrams (mg) of folic acid each day as a separate supplement at least 3 months before pregnancy and for the first 3 months of pregnancy. You and your ob-gyn or other obstetric care provider can discuss whether you need to supplement with more than 400 micrograms daily.`

        id: 'Exercise4',
        question: "How much should I exercise during pregnancy?",
        answer: `Ideally, pregnant women should get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity every week. An aerobic activity is one in which you move large muscles of the body (like those in the legs and arms) in a rhythmic way. Moderate intensity means you are moving enough to raise your heart rate and start sweating. You still can talk normally, but you cannot sing.
        \nExamples of moderate-intensity aerobic activity include brisk walking and general gardening (raking, weeding, or digging). You can divide the 150 minutes into 30-minute workouts on 5 days of the week or into smaller 10-minute workouts throughout each day.
        \nIf you are new to exercise, start out slowly and gradually increase your activity. Begin with as little as 5 minutes a day. Add 5 minutes each week until you can stay active for 30 minutes a day.
        \nIf you were very active before pregnancy, you can keep doing the same workouts with your obstetrician’s approval. However, if you start to lose weight, you may need to increase the number of calories that you eat.`

        id: 'Exercise5',
        question: "What changes occur in the body during pregnancy that can affect my exercise routine?",
        answer: `Your body goes through many changes during pregnancy. It is important to choose exercises that take these changes into account:
        \n\u2b24Joints—The hormones made during pregnancy cause the ligaments that support your joints to become relaxed. This makes the joints more mobile and at risk of injury. Avoid jerky, bouncy, or high-impact motions that can increase your risk of being hurt.
        \n\u2b24Balance—The extra weight in the front of your body shifts your center of gravity. This places stress on joints and muscles, especially those in your pelvis and lower back. Because you are less stable and more likely to lose your balance, you are at greater risk of falling.
        \n\u2b24Breathing—When you exercise, oxygen and blood flow are directed to your muscles and away from other areas of your body. While you are pregnant, your need for oxygen increases. This may affect your ability to do strenuous exercise, especially if you are overweight or obese.`

        id: 'Exercise6',
        question: "What precautions should I take when exercising during pregnancy?",
        answer: `There are a few precautions that pregnant women should keep in mind during exercise:
        \n\u2b24Drink plenty of water before, during, and after your workout. Signs of dehydration include dizziness, a racing or pounding heart, and urinating only small amounts or having urine that is dark yellow.
        \n\u2b24Wear a sports bra that gives lots of support to help protect your breasts. Later in pregnancy, a belly support belt may reduce discomfort while walking or running.
        \n\u2b24Avoid becoming overheated, especially in the first trimester. Drink plenty of water, wear loose-fitting clothing, and exercise in a temperature-controlled room. Do not exercise outside when it is very hot or humid.
        \n\u2b24Avoid standing still or lying flat on your back as much as possible. When you lie on your back, your uterus presses on a large vein that returns blood to the heart. Standing motionless can cause blood to pool in your legs and feet. These positions may cause your blood pressure to decrease for a short time.`

      {
        id: 'Exercise7',
        question: "What are some safe exercises that I can do during pregnancy?",
        answer: `Experts agree these exercises are safest for pregnant women:
        \n\u2b24Walking—Brisk walking gives a total body workout and is easy on the joints and muscles.
        \n\u2b24Swimming and water workouts—Water workouts use many of the body’s muscles. The water supports your weight so you avoid injury and muscle strain.
        \n\u2b24Stationary bicycling—Because your growing belly can affect your balance and make you more prone to falls, riding a standard bicycle during pregnancy can be risky. Cycling on a stationary bike is a better choice.
        \n\u2b24Modified yoga and modified Pilates—Yoga reduces stress, improves flexibility, and encourages stretching and focused breathing. There are prenatal yoga and Pilates classes designed for pregnant women. These classes often teach modified poses that accommodate a pregnant woman’s shifting balance. You also should avoid poses that require you to be still or lie on your back for long periods.
        \n\u2b24If you are an experienced runner, jogger, or racquet-sports player, you may be able to keep doing these activities during pregnancy. Discuss these activities with your obstetrician or other member of your health care team.`

        question: "What is COVID-19?",
        answer: `COVID-19 is a new illness that affects the lungs and breathing. It is caused by a new coronavirus. Symptoms include fever, cough, and trouble breathing. It also may cause stomach problems, such as nausea and diarrhea, and a loss of your sense of smell or taste. Symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after you are exposed to the virus. Some people with COVID-19 may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms.`

        questions: "How does COVID-19 affect pregnant women?",
        answer: `Researchers are still learning how COVID-19 affects pregnant women. Current reports suggest that pregnant women have a higher risk for more severe illness from COVID-19 than nonpregnant women. Reports note that:\n\u2b24Pregnant women who have COVID-19 and show symptoms are more likely than nonpregnant women with COVID-19 and symptoms to need care in an intensive care unit (ICU), to need a ventilator (for breathing support), or to die from the illness. Still, the overall risk of severe illness and death for pregnant women is low.\n\u2b24Pregnant women with some health conditions, such as obesity and gestational diabetes, may have an even higher risk of severe illness, similar to nonpregnant women with these conditions.\n\u2b24Pregnant women who are Black or Hispanic have a higher rate of illness and death from COVID-19 than other pregnant women, but not because of biology. Black and Hispanic women are more likely to face social, health, and economic inequities that put them at greater risk of illness.`

        answer: `Remember that researchers are learning more about COVID-19 all the time. Some researchers are looking specifically at COVID-19 and its possible effects on a fetus. Here’s what they know now:\n\u2b24Researchers have found a few cases of COVID-19 that may have passed to a fetus during pregnancy, but this seems to be rare.\n\u2b24Researchers have studied COVID-19 infection, preterm birth, and stillbirth. Some studies suggest there may be an increased risk of preterm birth and stillbirth for women with COVID-19. Other studies have not found this to be true. But information is still limited. Researchers are continuing to study these outcomes to better understand the effects of COVID-19 before birth.\n\u2b24After birth, a newborn can get the virus if they are exposed to it.`

        question: "Is it safe to get a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy?",
        answer: `Pregnant women may choose to get a COVID-19 vaccine. There is a limited amount of safety data available on COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy at this time, but what experts know so far is reassuring.\n\u2b24The tests done before the first vaccines were approved for emergency use did not include pregnant women. But based on how the vaccines were made and the science behind how the vaccines work in the body, experts believe they should be safe in pregnancy. The CDC and some of the COVID-19 vaccine makers are now starting or planning tests with pregnant women. And thousands of pregnant women have already chosen to receive COVID-19 vaccines. Some of them have enrolled in the CDC’s vaccination tracking program. Data from this program do not show any safety concerns.\n\u2b24If you are pregnant and want to know more about the vaccines, you can talk with your obstetrician–gynecologist (ob-gyn) or other health care professional. This conversation is not required to get a vaccine, though it may be helpful. You can discuss your risk of getting COVID-19 and your risk of severe illness if you get sick. A vaccine may protect you from severe illness, which could help both you and your fetus.`

        answer: `It is common to feel side effects after getting a COVID-19 vaccine. There are different types of COVID-19 vaccines that have varying side effects. Side effects also vary from person to person. Some vaccines may make you feel like you have the flu for a few days. This is normal.\n\u2b24If you have a fever or other side effects after getting the vaccine, you can take acetaminophen, an over-the-counter medication that is safe during pregnancy. If you are worried about your side effects or they last more than a few days, talk with your ob-gyn or other health care professional.`

None of the vaccines use the live virus that causes COVID-19.\n\u2b24The vaccines do not affect your genes or DNA.\n\u2b24There is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility.

        question: "Why are face coverings important?",
        answer: `The CDC says all people, including pregnant women, should wear a cloth face covering or mask when they are in public to slow the spread of COVID-19. Face coverings are recommended because studies have shown that people can spread the virus before showing any symptoms.\n\u2b24Wearing a cloth face covering or mask is most important in places where you may not be able to stay 6 feet away from other people, like a grocery store or pharmacy. It also is important in parts of the country where COVID-19 is spreading quickly. But you should still try to stay at least 6 feet away from others whenever you leave home.\n\u2b24If you have COVID-19 or think you may have it, you should wear a mask while you are around other people. You also should wear a mask if you are taking care of someone who has COVID-19 or has symptoms. You do not need to wear a surgical mask or medical-grade mask (N95 mask).`

Some women may have fewer or more spaced out in-person visits. You also may talk more with your health care team over the phone or through an online video call. This is called telemedicine or telehealth. It is a good way for you to get the care you need while preventing the spread of disease.\n\u2b24If you have a visit scheduled, your care team’s office may call you ahead of time.

Most pregnant women who are due for screenings, tests, vaccines, or other care from any health care professionals can go ahead with these appointments, with appropriate safety measures in place at the health care office.\n\u2b24You should call the office before your appointment to ask what precautions they are taking, including mask and support-person policies. You also can ask if telehealth is an option for your appointment. If you have an in-person visit, it is important to wear a cloth face covering or mask, stay at least 6 feet away from other people when possible, and keep your hands clean.

        question: "Where will my baby stay after delivery if I have COVID-19?",
        answer: `There are many benefits to having your baby stay in the same room as you after delivery, even if you have COVID-19. For example, rooming together may help you bond with your baby and help you start breastfeeding if desired.\n\u2b24You also may choose for your baby to stay separated from you, such as in the hospital nursery. But current reports suggest that the risk of a baby getting COVID-19 does not change based on whether the baby stays in the mother’s room or in a separate room. If you room together, the baby’s crib may be kept at least 6 feet away from you. Some facilities use clear plastic cribs that are enclosed and keep an even temperature.\n\u2b24Staying in a separate room may be encouraged if you are very sick or your baby is at a high risk of getting very sick. If you choose to be separated and you plan to breastfeed, you can ask for a breast pump and use it to express (pump) milk. This will allow someone who is not sick to bottle-feed breast milk to your baby. Pumping also may help you maintain your milk supply for when you begin breastfeeding.\n\u2b24Talk with your health care team about the options at your hospital or birth center well before your due date. Together you can discuss what you think is right for you and your baby.

        answer: `When taken under a doctor’s care, opioids are safe for both you and your fetus. If you are prescribed an opioid before or during pregnancy, you and your ob-gyn or other obstetric care provider should discuss the risks and benefits of this treatment. It is important to take the medication only as prescribed.`

        question: "What is the best treatment for opioid use disorder?",
        answer: `The best treatment for opioid use disorder during pregnancy is opioid replacement medication, behavioral therapy, and counseling. The medications that are given are long-acting opioids. This means that they stay active in the body for a long time. These opioids, called methadone and buprenorphine, reduce cravings but do not cause the pleasant feelings that other opioids cause.`

        question: "Is it safe to take methadone or buprenorphine during pregnancy?",

        question: "What is the treatment for a baby’s withdrawal symptoms?",
        answer: `Not all babies will go through withdrawal. For those that do, some things can be done to make babies with NAS feel better, including swaddling, breastfeeding, and skin-to-skin contact. Some babies also may be given medication. A baby may need to stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for a few days or weeks while taking the medication. NAS causes no known lasting physical or intellectual problems for babies.`

        question: "What is labor induction?",
        answer: `Inducing labor, or induction, is the act of using drugs or a procedure to start the birth sooner, instead of waiting for labor to start naturally. Sometimes induction is the right source, but it has its risks and doesn't always work. If it doesn't, you may need another induction or a c-section. Most experts say it's best to let labor begin on its own and progress naturally unless there is a clear medical reason.`

        question: "Why is labor induced?",
        answer: `1 out of 4 women in the U.S. start labor with induction. Some reasons:
        \n\u2b24You're 1-2 weeks past your due date.
        \n\u2b24Your water breaks but labor doesn't start, raising the risk of infection.
        \n\u2b24A problem puts you or your baby's health at risk. Such problems include conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, preeclampsia, or eclampsia.
        \nSome doctors recommend \"elective\" inductions for non-medical reasons. Maybe you live far from the hospital or maybe your doctor asks you to accommodate their schedule. Experts say you should reconsider though, because induction poses some risks.`
